# Glyma
In order to compile Glyma you will need to make use of the Telerik Silverlight controls which can be downloaded here.

These controls are not free and you will need to purchase a license to use them.

If you are in need of compiled version of the software, Seven Sigma are able to provide them. You can contact someone at Seven Sigma through their email at info@sevensigma.com.au.
